<a class="anchor" name="Creating_Posts"></a>
### Creating Posts

To create a post, click on the "Submit a Story" link in the upper right corner.

Posts have three main parts: Title, Content, Tags.

You will want to make your title attention grabbing, and relevant to your content.

To create your content, you can either use "Editor" or "Markdown" mode.

There are several guides for creating posts in the "Helpful Posts from WEKUit Users" section below.

<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Tags"></a>
### Tags

Tags will help people find your posts.

Each post can have up to 9 tags, separated by spaces.

The first tag in the list will be the main category that the post is in.

The tags should all be relevant to the content in the post.

<a class="anchor" name="Followers_and_Feeds"></a>
### Followers and Feeds

To follow an author, click on their username and click the "Follow" button.

Once you follow someone, all of their posts will show up in your "Feed" on the homepage when you login.

As other WEKUians come across your posts and comments, you will start to gain followers.

You can see all of your followers and the people you are following in your profile page.

<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Digital_Currencies"></a>
### Digital Currencies

WEKU, WEKU Power and WEKU Dollars are the three forms of digital currency used by the WEKU Blockchain.

More information on the three types of tokens can be found in the [WEKU FAQ](https://live.WEKU.io/faq.html).

<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Curation"></a>
### Curation

Up to 25% of the reward for posts goes to the people who voted on it. These people are called curators.

The more WEKU Power you have in your account, the more your upvotes will be worth, and the more potential curation rewards you can earn!

<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Payments"></a>
### Payments

Payouts are made 7 days after the post/comment is created. You can claim your rewards in your wallet after 7 days.

The payments may fluctuate (up and down) until the final payment is reached.

Payments for posts are split between the author (at least 75%) and the curators (up to 25%).

The author reward is paid 50% in WEKU Power, and 50% in liquid WEKU/WKD.

Authors also have the option to decline payout, or be paid in 100% WEKU Power!

**Home** - Most recent posts of the people you follow (your feed).

**New** - Posts are sorted by the time posted, newest first.

**Hot** - Popular posts at the moment.

**Trending** - Posts with the highest pending rewards currently.

<a class="anchor" name="Reputation"></a>
### Reputation

A reputation score is one way WEKUit measures the amount of value you have brought to the community.

The higher the number, the more weighted votes an account has earned.

All new users start at 25.

Your reputation will go up as you earn upvotes for your posts and comments, but it can come down if they are flagged.

<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Cashing_out_or_Spending_WKD"></a>
### Cashing out or Spending WKD

TBD

You can also "Power Up" and use your WEKU/WKD to gain more WEKU Power!

<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Plagiarism"></a>
### Plagiarism

The community is looking for you to add your own personal touch to your articles.

Plagiarizing, that is posting someone else's work as if it were your own, is very frowned upon by the WEKUit community.

If you are using anyone else's material as part of your posts (including images) - please cite your sources.

Also, make sure that you are not violating any copyright laws if you are using someone else's material/images. Limited, sourced material sharing is OK under fair use and fair dealing doctrines.

<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Password_Security"></a>
### Password Security

Your WEKUit account is worth real money. Treat your WEKUit password like you would your bank password, and keep it secure!

Unless your password was recently changed and you possess the old one, **there is no password recovery for WEKU accounts**. You are 100% responsible for having it backed up. This means secure digital backups, as well as secured paper backups, off-site if possible.

<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Earning_on_WEKUit"></a>
### Earning on WEKUit

The best attitude to have is to expect to make nothing. Have fun. Get engaged. Make friends. If along the way you earn something - bonus!

It is possible to earn thousands of dollars, but most authors who are doing this have put in a lot of time and work to contribute to the community and build followings.

<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>

## To Do List

<a class="anchor" name="Backup_your_password"></a>
### 1. Backup your password

Unlike centralized web services, **the WEKU Blockchain has no account password recovery**.

You are entirely responsible for keeping your password, and keeping it secure.

Save your master key and keep it somewhere safe.

It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as a flash drive or burned CD, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

If your account is valuable, treat it like a valuable!


<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Setup_your_Profile_Avatar_and_Cover_Image"></a>
### 3. Setup your Profile, Avatar, and Cover Image

Under your user settings, you can update your profile. This includes your display name, location, about info, and website.

To set your avatar image, type or paste a link to the URL where the image is located into the "Profile Picture URL" field.

To set your cover image, type or paste a link to the URL where the image is located into the "Cover Image URL" field.

Once you have made all your changes, click the "Update" button to save your profile.

<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Choose_your_NSFW_(Not_Safe_for_Work)_Display_Preference"></a>
### 4. Choose your "NSFW" (Not Safe for Work) Display Preference

By default, content that users have tagged as "NSFW" will be hidden, but a link will be shown to reveal the content.

You can update your display preference so that NSFW content is always shown by default, or is completely hidden with no option to reveal.

<a href="/welcome#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Create_your_introduceyourself_post"></a>
### 5. Create your "introduceyourself" post

While not required, the tradition for new users is to create an "introduceyourself" post, to let the community know who you are.

You can see some examples of what other people have done [here](https://WEKU.IO/trending30/introduceyourself).

It is not required, but a lot of users will take a picture of themselves holding up a piece of paper that says "WEKUit" with the current date, so we know you are a real person.

It is not required either, but if you have other social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) you can help the community verify that you are who you say you are, by sharing the link to your WEKUit introduceyourself post with those accounts. If you are claiming to be someone famous, this is pretty much expected.
